#for site ((( VirtualMeditationTree.com )))

# 1) 5 seperate page templates for optimal functionality
# 2) coorelate the quiz functions to the template type
# 3) Store quiz results by the quiz type and then label the results by template skin 1-5
# 4) attempt to coorelate each base meditation quiz type to a template, VI, RE, FO, HC, MI, ( HC ) is a bodily state so the template abbreviated (HC) Will be a hybrid of (VI, RE, FO, and MI.
# 5) Each quiz could have the monk clone of base type for the personality response. So the Meditation master responds in his field quiz.
#6) HC Quiz is not hybrid based only the template is.
